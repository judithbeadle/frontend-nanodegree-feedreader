## The Project

This project is part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree. 

Starting with a Feedreader app ([see source code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)), the project allows to run a comprehensive list of tests using the [Jasmine framework](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html)

## Running tests 

To be able to view or alter tests you first need to clone this repository or download all the files.

### Dependencies 

For testing to work, you need the Jasmine framework. All necessary files are included under jasmine/lib.

### viewing tests and test results

Open index.html in your preferred browser. After the content loads, you will find the test results at the bottom of the page.

### creating your own tests or altering tests

The test suites can be found under jasmine/spec/feedreader.js. For Documentation on how to write tests, have a look at the [Jasmine documentation page](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html). To better understand existing tests the index.html or js/app.js files can also be altered. For example, see what happens when changing or removing feed urls.
